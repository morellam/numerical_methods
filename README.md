# numerical_methods
Repository with exercises done for HE-8 numerical methods course at GSSI XXXVI cycle. 

To compile, run the code and looking at the results for a specific algorithm just execute:
```
make *algorithm_name*
```
Available *algorithm_name* :
- simpson
- ode
Executables files are saved in the *output* directory generated by `make` while `.txt` files in *pyplot*. 
If you want to remove executables and text files generated at runtime:
```
make clean
```
